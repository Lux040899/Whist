# SWEN30006 Project 2 - Whist
## Canvas Instructions
This project concerns a simple version of the card game [Whist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whist), played with a standard 52-card deck.

If you are not familiar with any games in the Whist family, or are not familiar with games based on the standard 52-card deck, we suggest you familiarise yourself by reading the basics about Whist, and playing some games if the opportunity is available to you.

Please read the [project specification](SWEN30006_Project2_spec.pdf) carefully.

You will be using a [Whist program](P2_Whist_v1.0.zip) based on a framework called [JCardGame](https://www.aplu.ch/home/apluhomex.jsp?site=91) for this project.
